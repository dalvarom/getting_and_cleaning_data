# The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
# The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers 
# on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set 
# as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) 
# a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to 
# clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. 
# This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  
#
# One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example  
# this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms
# to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers 
# from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 
#   
#  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
# 
# Here are the data for the project: 
#   
#  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
#
# You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
# 1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
# 3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
# 5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
